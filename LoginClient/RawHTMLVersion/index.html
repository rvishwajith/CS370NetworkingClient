This webpage is the current front end for the login client that is used to
authenticate the user from their desktop device. HTML/CSS is being used for
quick prototyping.

There are 2 ways to log in:

1. With a password:
The user must enter their username or email address for the account as well as
the password. If the account has multiple email addresses listed, any of them
may be used.

2. With a QR code:
This only works if the user is trying to login and is already authenticated on
a mobile client. The QR code is generated using a third-party (open-source)
library
